B Hello Dr. Whiskers. Thank you for joining me today.
B I know it's a tough time for everyone, especially with the holidays approaching.
B Unfortunately, after careful consideration we've decided to terminate your employment.
B Frankly, your performance has been sub par. Your biscuits are constantly lacking. Your pounces are pathetic. And you can barely catch a mouse anymore.
B You call yourself a Doctor of Feline Communication? Frankly I'm disapointed.
B We do wish you the best of luck finding a role that better suits your skill level.
B I expect your ball of yarn and laser pointer returned by the end of day!
B Bah bye~ :3
D ...
D I guess I have to refine my skills and update my resume.
D Time to start training...
